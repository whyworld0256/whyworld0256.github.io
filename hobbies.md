# Competitive programming

Competitive programming is a mind sport that involves solving  well-defined computational problems using algorithms and data structures within a specified time limit. Participants, often referred to as  competitive programmers, compete in online or onsite contests where they are given a set of problems to solve. The goal is to write efficient  and correct code to solve these problems as quickly as possible.

Through the programming competition, I not only wrote a lot of code and improved my programming ability, but more importantly, I developed programming thinking, knowing how to think about problems from the perspective of computers and what problems are suitable for computers to solve

On leetcode, a popular algorithm contest site, I scored [1,893](https://leetcode.cn/u/why-iz2/), ranking 6.29% globally.



# Online CS Courses

As a student who is majoring in pure mathematics, I didn't have much exposure to computer science. As some famous universities (like CMU, UCB, Stanford ……) in the world open their courses online, it provides me with good learning materials. 

In the process of learning these high-quality courses, I read a lot of relevant books and completed corresponding experiments, which laid the foundation for my computer knowledge system and stimulated my deep interest in computer science
