`Needle` is  PyTorch-like deep learning framework mainly designed for education purpose, which supports nearly all the basic necessary elements of deep learning, you can build a deep learning model by using these modules we made.

- Common operators (e.g. matmul, conv),  optimizer(e.g. SGD, Adam) and models (e.g. CNN, Resnet, LSTM).
- Automatic differentiation
- CPU and GPU  NDArray backends
